<h1>H.W.A.T.</h1>
The Housewife Aptitude Test

Can you cook?
Can you clean?
Can you do both? (Faux gasp)

H.W.A.T puts your mind and temperament to the test to determine your true housewife aptitude-- both inherent and acquired. You only have one shot per answer, so remember to always answer as honestly and earnestly as possible!
